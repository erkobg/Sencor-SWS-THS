# Tap data from wireless remote sensor Sencor SWS THS

I have Digital Weather Station from Sencor with external remote sensor model - SWS THS

It was working Very good for me all the time.
Recently I bought some 433 RF receivers and was playing around, when I decided to try to tap data from this external device and read it in Arduino/Wemos.

I started looking for different ways to achieve this goal, started reading different reverse engineering tutorials, like:
http://hackaday.com/2015/03/01/reverse-engineering-wireless-temperature-probes/
http://rayshobby.net/reverse-engineer-wireless-temperature-humidity-rain-sensors-part-1/
https://rayshobby.net/interface-with-remote-power-sockets-final-version/

But being lazy I searched the web for any existing codes.
I came around this example:
http://arduino.cz/meteostanice-ovladana-arduinem/

It is done by Czech enthusiast : Zby≈°ek Voda and he already decoded and provided main elements of the SWS THS protocol.
